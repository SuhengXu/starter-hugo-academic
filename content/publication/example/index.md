abstract: The development of electronics and photonics is entering a new era of
  ultrahigh speed sensing, data processing, and telecommunication. The carrier
  frequencies of the next-generation electronic devices inevitably extend beyond
  radio frequencies, marching toward the nominally photonics-dominated
  territories, e.g., terahertz and beyond. As a result, electronic and photonic
  techniques naturally merge and seek common ground. At the forefront of this
  technical trend is the field of polaritonics, where polaritons are half-light,
  half-matter quasiparticles that carry the properties of both “bare” photons
  and “bare” dipole-carrying excitations. The Janus-faced nature of polaritons
  renders the unique capability of operando control using photoexcitation or
  applied electric field. Here, state-of-the-art ultrafast polaritonic phenomena
  probed by scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope (s-SNOM)
  techniques is reviewed. The ultrafast dynamical control and loss-reduction of
  the polariton propagation are discussed with special emphasis on the creation
  and probing of the tip or edge induced plasmon– and phonon–polaritons in
  low-dimensional systems. The detailed technical aspects of s-SNOM and its
  possible future development are also presented.
