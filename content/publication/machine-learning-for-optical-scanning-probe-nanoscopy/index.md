abstract: The ability to perform nanometer-scale optical imaging and
  spectroscopy is key to deciphering the low-energy effects in quantum
  materials, as well as vibrational fingerprints in planetary and
  extraterrestrial particles, catalytic substances, and aqueous biological
  samples. These tasks can be accomplished by the scattering-type scanning
  near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) technique that has recently spread to
  many research fields and enabled notable discoveries. Herein, it is shown that
  the s-SNOM, together with scanning probe research in general, can benefit in
  many ways from artificial-intelligence (AI) and machine-learning (ML)
  algorithms. Augmented with AI- and ML-enhanced data acquisition and analysis,
  scanning probe optical nanoscopy is poised to become more efficient, accurate,
  and intelligent.
