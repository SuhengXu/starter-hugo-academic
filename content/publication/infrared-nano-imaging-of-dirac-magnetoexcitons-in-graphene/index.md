abstract: Magnetic fields can have profound effects on the motion of electrons
  in quantum materials. Two-dimensional electron systems subject to strong
  magnetic fields are expected to exhibit quantized Hall conductivity, chiral
  edge currents and distinctive collective modes referred to as magnetoplasmons
  and magnetoexcitons. Generating these propagating collective modes in
  charge-neutral samples and imaging them at their native nanometre length
  scales have thus far been experimentally elusive. Here we visualize
  propagating magnetoexciton polaritons at their native length scales and report
  their magnetic-field-tunable dispersion in near-charge-neutral graphene.
  Imaging these collective modes and their associated nano-electro-optical
  responses allows us to identify polariton-modulated optical and photo-thermal
  electric effects at the sample edges, which are the most pronounced near
  charge neutrality. Our work is enabled by innovations in cryogenic near-field
  optical microscopy techniques that allow for the nano-imaging of the
  near-field responses of two-dimensional materials under magnetic fields up to
  7â€‰T. This nano-magneto-optics approach allows us to explore and manipulate
  magnetopolaritons in specimens with low carrier doping via harnessing high
  magnetic fields.
