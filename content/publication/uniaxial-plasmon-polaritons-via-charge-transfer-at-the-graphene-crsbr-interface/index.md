abstract: Graphene is a privileged 2D platform for hosting confined light-matter
  excitations known as surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs), as it possesses low
  intrinsic losses with a high degree of optical confinement. However, the
  inherently isotropic optical properties of graphene limit its ability to guide
  and focus SPPs, making it less suitable than anisotropic elliptical and
  hyperbolic materials as a platform for polaritonic lensing and canalization.
  Here, we present the graphene/CrSBr heterostructure as an engineered 2D
  interface that hosts highly anisotropic SPP propagation over a wide range of
  frequencies in the mid-infrared and terahertz. Using a combination of scanning
  tunneling microscopy (STM), scattering-type scanning near-field optical
  microscopy (s-SNOM), and first-principles calculations, we demonstrate mutual
  doping in excess of 1013 cmâˆ’2 holes/electrons between the interfacial layers
  of graphene/CrSBr heterostructures. SPPs in graphene activated by charge
  transfer interact with charge-induced anisotropic intra- and interband
  transitions in the interfacial doped CrSBr, leading to preferential SPP
  propagation along the quasi-1D chains that compose each CrSBr layer. This
  multifaceted proximity effect both creates SPPs and endows them with
  anisotropic transport and propagation lengths that differ by an
  order-of-magnitude between the two in-plane crystallographic axes of CrSBr.
