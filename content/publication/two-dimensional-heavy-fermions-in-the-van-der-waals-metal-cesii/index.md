abstract: Heavy-fermion metals are prototype systems for observing emergent
  quantum phases driven by electronic interactions1–6. A long-standing
  aspiration is the dimensional reduction of these materials to exert control
  over their quantum phases7–11, which remains a significant challenge because
  traditional intermetallic heavy-fermion compounds have three-dimensional
  atomic and electronic structures. Here we report comprehensive thermodynamic
  and spectroscopic evidence of an antiferromagnetically ordered heavy-fermion
  ground state in CeSiI, an intermetallic comprising two-dimensional (2D)
  metallic sheets held together by weak interlayer van der Waals (vdW)
  interactions. Owing to its vdW nature, CeSiI has a quasi-2D electronic
  structure, and we can control its physical dimension through exfoliation. The
  emergence of coherent hybridization of f and conduction electrons at low
  temperature is supported by the temperature evolution of angle-resolved
  photoemission and scanning tunnelling spectra near the Fermi level and by heat
  capacity measurements. Electrical transport measurements on few-layer flakes
  reveal heavy-fermion behaviour and magnetic order down to the ultra-thin
  regime. Our work establishes CeSiI and related materials as a unique platform
  for studying dimensionally confined heavy fermions in bulk crystals and
  employing 2D device fabrication techniques and vdW heterostructures12 to
  manipulate the interplay between Kondo screening, magnetic order and proximity
  effects.
