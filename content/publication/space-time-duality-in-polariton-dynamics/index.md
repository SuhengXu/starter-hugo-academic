abstract: The spatial and temporal dynamics of wave propagation are intertwined.
  A common manifestation of this duality emerges in the spatial and temporal
  decay of waves as they propagate through a lossy medium. A complete
  description of the non-Hermitian wave dynamics, capturing temporal and spatial
  decays, necessitates the use of complex-valued frequency and/or wavenumber
  eigen-values. Here, we demonstrate that the propagation of polaritons – hybrid
  light-matter quasiparticles – can be broadly controlled in space and time by
  temporally shaping their photonic excitation. Using time-domain terahertz
  near-field nanoscopy, we study plasmon polaritons in bilayer graphene at
  sub-picosecond time scales. Suppressed spatial decay of polaritons is
  implemented by temporally engineering the excitation waveform. Polaritonic
  space-time metrology data agree with our dynamic model. Through the
  experimental realization and visualization of polaritonic space-time duality,
  we uncover the effects of the spatio-temporal engineering of wave dynamics;
  these are applicable to acoustic, photonic, plasmonic, and electronic systems.
