abstract: Chiral Weyl fermions with linear energy-momentum dispersion in the
  bulk accompanied by Fermi-arc states on the surfaces prompt a host of enticing
  optical effects. While new Weyl semimetal materials keep emerging, the
  available optical probes are limited. In particular, isolating bulk and
  surface electrodynamics in Weyl conductors remains a challenge. We devised an
  approach to the problem based on near-field photocurrent imaging at the
  nanoscale and applied this technique to a prototypical Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4.
  As a first step, we visualized nano-photocurrent patterns in real space and
  demonstrated their connection to bulk nonlinear conductivity tensors through
  extensive modeling augmented with density functional theory calculations.
  Notably, our nanoscale probe gives access to not only the in-plane but also
  the out-of-plane electric fields so that it is feasible to interrogate all
  allowed nonlinear tensors including those that remained dormant in
  conventional far-field optics. Surface- and bulk-related nonlinear
  contributions are distinguished through their “symmetry fingerprints” in the
  photocurrent maps. Robust photocurrents also appear at mirror-symmetry
  breaking edges of TaIrTe4 single crystals that we assign to nonlinear
  conductivity tensors forbidden in the bulk. Nano-photocurrent spectroscopy at
  the boundary reveals a strong resonance structure absent in the interior of
  the sample, providing evidence for elusive surface states.
