abstract: Polaritons are light-matter quasiparticles that govern the optical response of quantum 
materials and enable their nanophotonic applications. We have studied a new type of 
polaritons arising in magnetized graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride 
(hBN). These polaritons stem from hybridization of Dirac magnetoexciton modes of 
graphene with waveguide phonon modes of hBN crystals. We refer to these quasiparticles as 
the Landau-phonon polaritons (LPPs). Using infrared magneto nanoscopy, we imaged LPPs 
and controlled their real-space propagation by varying the magnetic field. These LLPs have 
large in-plane momenta and are not bound by the conventional optical selection rules, 
granting us access to the “forbidden” inter-Landau level transitions (ILTs). We observed 
avoided crossings in the LPP dispersion – a hallmark of the strong coupling regime – 
occurring when the magnetoexciton and hBN phonon frequencies matched. Our LPP-based 
nanoscopy also enabled us to resolve two fundamental many-body effects: the graphene 
Fermi velocity renormalization and ILT-dependent magnetoexciton binding 
energies. These results indicate that magnetic-field-tuned Dirac heterostructures are 
promising platforms for precise nanoscale control and sensing of light-matter interaction.
