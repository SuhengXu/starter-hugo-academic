abstract: 'Polaritons are light-matter quasiparticles that govern the optical
  response of quantum materials and enable their nanophotonic applications. We
  have studied a new type of polaritons arising in magnetized graphene
  encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). These polaritons stem from
  hybridization of Dirac magnetoexciton modes of graphene with waveguide phonon
  modes of hBN crystals. We refer to these quasiparticles as the Landau-phonon
  polaritons (LPPs). Using infrared magneto nanoscopy, we imaged LPPs and
  controlled their real-space propagation by varying the magnetic field. These
  LLPs have large in-plane momenta and are not bound by the conventional optical
  selection rules, granting us access to the "forbidden" inter-Landau level
  transitions (ILTs). We observed avoided crossings in the LPP dispersion - a
  hallmark of the strong coupling regime - occurring when the magnetoexciton and
  hBN phonon frequencies matched. Our LPP-based nanoscopy also enabled us to
  resolve two fundamental many-body effects: the graphene Fermi velocity
  renormalization and ILT-dependent magnetoexciton binding energies. These
  results indicate that magnetic-field-tuned Dirac heterostructures are
  promising platforms for precise nanoscale control and sensing of light-matter
  interaction.'
