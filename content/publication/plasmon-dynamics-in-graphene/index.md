abstract: Plasmons are collective oscillations of mobile electrons. Using terahertz spacetime metrology, we probe plasmon dynamics of mono- and bi-layer graphene. In both systems, the experimentally measured Drude weight systematically exceeds the prediction based on non-interacting electronic system. This enhancement is most
pronounced at ultra-low carrier densities. We attribute the observed deviation to pseudospin dynamics of the Dirac
fermions in multi-layer graphene, which leads to a breakdown of Galilean invariance. Our results establish that
pseudospin structure of the single-particle electronic wave function can directly govern collective excitations, with
implications that extend beyond graphene to a broad class of quantum materials.
