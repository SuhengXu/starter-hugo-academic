abstract: "Ultraclean graphene at charge neutrality hosts a quantum critical
  Dirac fluid of interacting electrons and holes. Interactions profoundly affect
  the charge dynamics of graphene, which is encoded in the properties of its
  electron-photon collective modes: surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). Here, we
  show that polaritonic interference patterns are particularly well suited to
  unveil the interactions in Dirac fluids by tracking polaritonic interference
  in time at temporal scales commensurate with the electronic scattering.
  Spacetime SPP interference patterns recorded in terahertz (THz) frequency
  range provided unobstructed readouts of the group velocity and lifetime of
  polariton that can be directly mapped onto the electronic spectral weight and
  the relaxation rate. Our data uncovered prominent departures of the electron
  dynamics from the predictions of the conventional Fermi-liquid theory. The
  deviations are particularly strong when the densities of electrons and holes
  are approximately equal. The proposed spacetime imaging methodology can be
  broadly applied to probe the electrodynamics of quantum materials."
