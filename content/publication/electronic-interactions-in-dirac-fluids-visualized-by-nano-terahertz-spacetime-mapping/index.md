abstract: "Ultraclean graphene at charge neutrality hosts a quantum critical
  Dirac fluid of interacting electrons and holes. Interactions profoundly affect
  the charge dynamics of graphene, which is encoded in the properties of its
  collective modes: surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs). The group velocity and
  lifetime of SPPs have a direct correspondence with the reactive and
  dissipative parts of the tera-Hertz (THz) conductivity of the Dirac fluid. We
  succeeded in tracking the propagation of SPPs over sub-micron distances at
  femto-second (fs) time scales. Our experiments uncovered prominent departures
  from the predictions of the conventional Fermi-liquid theory. The deviations
  are particularly strong when the densities of electrons and holes are
  approximately equal. Our imaging methodology can be used to probe the
  electromagnetics of quantum materials other than graphene in order to provide
  fs-scale diagnostics under near-equilibrium conditions."
