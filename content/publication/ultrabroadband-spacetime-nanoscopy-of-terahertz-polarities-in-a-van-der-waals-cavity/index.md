abstract: Guiding, storing, and processing light at the nanoscale hinges on
  understanding how polaritons — hybrid quasiparticles of light and matter —
  propagate and interfere in both space and time. This work introduces a
  synchrotron-based technique, SYnchrotron SpaceTimE Mapping (SYSTEM), which
  captures real-time evolution of polariton wave packets with ∼10 nm spatial and
  sub-100 fs temporal resolution across an ultrabroadband 5–50 THz range. Here,
  SYSTEM directly visualizes the creation, interference, and decay of multiple
  high-quality Fabry-Pérot phonon polariton cavity modes in an α-MoO3
  microcavity. These real-space, real-time observations reveal wave-packet
  dynamics and cavity resonances with record-high quality factors (Q ≈ 100) in
  the single-digit terahertz regime near 9 THz. SYSTEM thus offers a powerful
  and broadly applicable platform for probing and engineering ultraslow, deeply
  subwavelength polaritons, opening new avenues for tailoring light–matter
  interactions and advancing next-generation THz nanophotonic technologies.
