abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) provide a window into the
  nano-optical, electrodynamic response of their host material and its
  dielectric environment. Graphene/α-RuCl3 serves as an ideal model system for
  imaging SPPs since the large work function difference between these two layers
  facilitates charge transfer that hole dopes graphene with n ∼ 1013 cm–2 free
  carriers. In this work, we study the emergent THz response of graphene/α-RuCl3
  heterostructures using our home-built cryogenic scanning near-field optical
  microscope. Using phase-resolved imaging, we clearly observe long wavelength,
  heavily damped THz SPPs in a series of variable-size graphene cavities. From
  this, we extract the plasmonic wavelength and scattering rate in the
  graphene/α-RuCl3 heterostructures. We determine that the measured plasmon
  wavelength and electronic scattering rate match our heterostructures’
  theoretically predicted values. Our results demonstrate that shaping graphene
  into bespoke cavity structures enables observation and quantification of SPPs
  in heavily doped graphene that are largely not addressable with other
  experimental techniques. Moreover, the manifest lack of metallicity observed
  in the adjacent doped α-RuCl3 layer provides significant constraints on the
  nature of the interfacial charge transfer in this 2D heterostructure.
