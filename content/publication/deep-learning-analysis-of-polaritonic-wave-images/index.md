Deep learning (DL) is an emerging analysis tool across the sciences and engineering. Encouraged by the successes of DL in revealing quantitative trends in massive imaging data, we applied this approach to nanoscale deeply subdiffractional images of propagating polaritonic waves in complex materials. Utilizing the convolutional neural network (CNN), we developed a practical protocol for the rapid regression of images that quantifies the wavelength and the quality factor of polaritonic waves. Using simulated near-field images as training data, the CNN can be made to simultaneously extract polaritonic characteristics and material parameters in a time scale that is at least 3 orders of magnitude faster than common fitting/processing procedures. The CNN-based analysis was validated by examining the experimental near-field images of charge-transfer plasmon polaritons at graphene/Î±-RuCl3 interfaces. Our work provides a general framework for extracting quantitative information from images generated with a variety of scanning probe methods.
