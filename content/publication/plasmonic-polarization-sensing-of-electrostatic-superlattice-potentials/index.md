abstract: Plasmon polaritons are formed by coupling light with delocalized
  electrons. The half-light and half-matter nature of plasmon polaritons endows
  them with unparalleled tunability via a range of parameters, such as
  dielectric environments and carrier density. Therefore, plasmon polaritons are
  expected to be tuned when in proximity to polar materials since the carrier
  density is tuned by an electrostatic potential; conversely, the plasmon
  polariton response might enable the sensing of polarization. Here, we use
  infrared nano-imaging and nano-photocurrent measurements to investigate
  heterostructures composed of graphene and twisted hexagonal boron nitride
  (t-BN), with alternating polarization in a triangular network of moiré
  stacking domains. We observe that the carrier density and the corresponding
  plasmonic response of graphene are modulated by polar domains in t-BN. In
  addition, we demonstrate that the nanometer-wide domain walls of graphene
  moirés superlattices, created by the polar domains of t-BN, provide momenta to
  assist the plasmonic excitations. Furthermore, our studies establish that the
  plasmon of graphene could function as a delicate sensor for polarization
  textures. The evolution of polarization textures in t-BN under uniform
  electric fields is tomographically examined via plasmonic imaging. Strikingly,
  no noticeable polarization switching is observed under applied electric fields
  up to 0.23 V/nm, at variance with transport reports. Our nano-images
  unambiguously reveal that t-BN with triangular domains acts like a
  ferrielectric, rather than ferroelectric claimed by many previous studies.
